When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    - When you want to share your work with others - this is useful when you are opening your software to public
    while at the same time allowing them to look at the source code to suggest changes. Or when you are working on a 
    project with a team you can share the code with them by using a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    - Because if we stay updated automatically then there might be changes made in the code that we donâ€™t want right now but they will become part of our local repository. There  might also be merge conflicts. So, it is better to manually pull when you are ready and committed with all the local changes.
